* TODO implement TAP together with SVG
 - [ ] Implement min-over-t for mse alone.
   - [ ] Sanity-check by switching off vae, and comparing min-over-t version against non-min-over-t version
 - [ ] Implement min-over-t for kl divergence + mse combined.
   - [ ] allow a hyperparameter that controls how many random time samples to compute min-over-t over for KL divergence.
 - [ ] Implement min-over-t for mse alone, but let vae encoder see entire video
